'''
The whoe idea of this module is to analyze population recording of the context probe pair paradigm used by Asary and Zador
in order to analize long term contextual effects

the pipeline of the analisis is as follows:
    1. Load the multi array data
     todo
    2. Model fitting? which models
        a. stp model
        b. Asary and zador models? reread
    3. calculate euclidean distance
     todo
    4. dimentionality reductions
        a. pca
        b. autoencoder
    5. Visualization.
